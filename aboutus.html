        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of amarble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
        delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe,
          having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.

          Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as
          equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.

          The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.

          Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
